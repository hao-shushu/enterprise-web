This Agreement includes (1) each Order Form that provides the type, quantity and payment terms for the Products purchased from ZAAR Technologies and the SAAS Services, (2) the Terms of Purchase and Use found at [www.zaarapp.com] as in effect from time to time, and (3) the Pre-Deployment Checklist executed by the parties. In the event of conflict among terms, the order of priority shall be the Order Forms, this Agreement, the Terms of Purchase and Use, and then the Pre-Deployment Checklist.</p>
      <p>1. ZAAR Technologies agrees to sell the Products and provide the SAAS Services described in each Order Form, and Customer agrees to pay for the Products and SAAS Services and comply with the terms and conditions set forth in this SAAS Subscription Agreement, each Order Form, and the Terms of Purchase and Use. As provided in each Order Form, the Products to be purchased may include master controllers configured to communicate with the Service Provider network operations center (each a “Gateway”) and/or activation kit(s) or other devices (the “Devices”) listed in the Order Form. The Products shall be for use in connection with accessing the SAAS System and use of the SAAS Services, for Customer's internal business purposes. The Fees for the Products are shown in the Order Form. Subsequent purchases of Products shall be made only from Service Provider, and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
      <p>2. The Term of Service for the SAAS Services is indicated in the Order Form for the SAAS Services. The SAAS Services may be accessed and used only by the number of Users specified in the Order Form(s), for the Fees corresponding to that number and type of Users. For each Usere, Customer will be provided a user name (User ID) and password, which enables the number of Customer's Users to access the SAAS System and use the SAAS Services. Following expiration of the Initial Term, the Term of Service will automatically renew for successive periods of subscribed number of months unless and until either party gives the other party notice of non-renewal at least 7 days prior to the next scheduled renewal date. Customer may elect Early Termination of the Services solely as permitted in the Terms of Purchase and Use for the Services.</p>
      <p>3. ZAAR Technologies grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, terminable, non-transferable license to access the SAAS Services through the SAAS System, or by any other means on which the parties may agree, and to use the SAAS Services during the Term or Service, subject to the Terms of Purchase and Use located at [www.zaarapp.com], as ZAAR Technologies may revise such Terms of Use from time to time.</p>
      <p>4. All other terms and conditions that are part of this Agreement shall be as set forth in the Terms of Purchase and Use, and this Agreement (inclusive of the Terms of Purchase and Use), and all Order Forms completed and approved pursuant to this Agreement, constitute the complete and exclusive terms of the agreement between the parties regarding the subject matter and supersedes all other prior and contemporaneous agreements or communications with respect to the subject matter hereof. In the event of a direct conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the then-current Terms of Use, the terms of the Agreement shall control.</p>
      <p>5. Customer represents and warrants that Customer has all necessary authorization to purchase and pay for the Products and SAAS Services indicated in each Order Form.</p>
      <p>6. In addition to the initial Order Form, the parties may enter into one or more additional Order Forms, each of which provides a general description of the Products and SAAS Services to be provided to Customer.

      <p>7. If there is any conflict between the terms of an Order Form and the terms of this SAAS Subscription Agreement or the Terms of Purchase and Use, then the terms of the Order Form shall control. Each Order Form, as supplemented by the terms of this SAAS Subscription Agreement and the Terms of Purchase and Use, constitutes an entire and separate agreement between the parties regarding the Products and SAAS Services covered by that Order Form, and supersedes any other prior oral or written understandings and agreements of the parties regarding the Products and SAAS Services covered by that Order Form. Any provisions contained in Customer's own purchase order forms, such as preprinted terms and conditions typically found on their reverse side, shall not apply and are superseded in their entirety by the provisions of this Subscription Agreement, including the applicable Order Form.
